## Project Workflow
### Step 1 -- *Establish MongoDB Connection*
Create a connection to the MongoDB Atlas database and initiate the process of retrieving the Airbnb dataset from it.
<br/>

### Step 2 -- *Data Cleaning and Preparation*
Prepare the Airbnb dataset for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization tasks by first addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and making appropriate data type transformations. This critical data preprocessing step is essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency, ensuring that the dataset is in an optimal state for further analysis.
<br/>

### Step 3 -- *Interactive Web Application*
Create a web application using Streamlit that harnesses geospatial information from the Airbnb dataset to generate interactive maps, allowing users to explore and engage with location-based data related to Airbnb listings and properties. This application will empower users to visualize and interact with the geographical aspects of Airbnb data, enhancing their understanding of property distribution, pricing trends, and other relevant insights within a map-centric interface.
<br/>

### Step 4 -- *Price Analysis and Visualization*
Utilize the refined dataset to conduct an analysis and generate visual representations showcasing the fluctuations in prices across various geographical locations, types of properties, and seasons. Develop interactive graphs and charts that empower users to investigate pricing trends, identify outliers, and discern correlations with other factors.
<br/>

### Step 5 -- *Comprehensive Dashboard*
Create a thorough dashboard using Tableau or Power BI to showcase critical findings derived from your analysis. Blend various visual elements like maps, charts, and tables to offer a complete perspective of the Airbnb dataset and its underlying trends.
